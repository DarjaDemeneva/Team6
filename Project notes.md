**Gene Project**

Add your notes and ideas to this file :)


Useful APIs for the project:

https://mygene.info for looking up a specific gene 

https://myvariant.info can use ClinVar annotations for deriving information about gene variants and disease-causing mutations

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/developers/ to look for publications 

https://www.programmableweb.com/api/pseudoviewer for visual representation of genetic structures involving RNA

https://www.ebi.ac.uk/proteins/api/doc/ for accessing data from UniProt

https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/api/index.html access to key biological data from QuickGo and GO. The services provide a unified interface to query information about ontology terms from GO (the Gene Ontology) and ECO (the Evidence & Conclusion Ontology), Gene Ontology annotations from the EBI's GOA database, and gene products (proteins from UniProt, RNA from RNAcentral and complexes from ComplexPortal).

http://pantherdb.org/services/openAPISpec.jsp The PANTHER (Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships) Classification System was designed to classify proteins (and their genes) in order to facilitate high-throughput analysis.
